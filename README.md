Explore a 2D grid of rooms, battle random monsters, search for gold, and manage your health as you journey through an ever-changing world. The game simulates player and NPC encounters using dice rolls to determine outcomes in combat, exploration, and survival. A great project for beginners looking to learn Java, JavaFX, and basic game mechanics!
